title: "Roboticist-In-Training"
research_statement: >
  I research robot failures and then try to help humans fix them. Specifically,
  my thesis aims to develop modules for use during failure interventions that
  can be used to increase the reliability of autonomous robots while reducing
  the demand on human stakeholders, such as robot developers or remote and
  collocated operators.
