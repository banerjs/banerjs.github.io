# Personal Website

This website runs on Jekyll and uses the [jekyll-resume](https://github.com/mattcouchman/jekyll-resume) theme on the homepage.

## Running locally

`bundle exec jekyll serve -P 8000`

## TODO

- Fix the DNS records for the site
- Create YAML files for the different sections of the resume, and fill them out
- Make more extensible YAML for description fields

# Nice to Haves

- Create PDF from YAML files - add links to download the PDF
