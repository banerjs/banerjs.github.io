# Personal Website

This website runs on Jekyll and uses the [jekyll-resume](https://github.com/mattcouchman/jekyll-resume) theme on the homepage.

## Running locally

`bundle exec jekyll serve -P 8000`

## TODO

- Incorporate automatic `bibtex` compilation into the data directory for inclusion into the CV. We can use jekyll-scholar for that purpose
- Create YAML files for the different sections of the resume
- Create an automated build from bibtex to YAML/MD so that github pages can display the site
